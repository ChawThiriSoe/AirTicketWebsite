			Tired of wasting money on unused flight tickets and hotel reservations? Fancy grabbing a 
			bargain flight or a holiday package while also helping a fellow traveller in a tough situation? 
			You have come to the right place!<br><br>
			At SpareFare, we believe that no opportunity should go wasted. And we want to inspire 
			people to travel more. We connect people who have bought a flight ticket or a hotel 
			reservation but cannot use it anymore, with people who are looking for plane tickets on 
			sale and discounted hotel rooms. That's right - you can resell your flight tickets as long as 
			your airline or travel operator allows name changes! Luckily, there are more than 60 major 
			airlines selling transferable plane <a href="flight.php" style="color: blue;"><b>tickets</b></a>!<br><br>
			SpareFare was founded by three friends who travel often and have personally lost money 
			on non-refundable transferable reservations. We wanted to banish that sinking feeling of 
			frustration you get when you have already paid for your plane tickets when you realise you 
			won't be able to use them. So we decided to create a secure marketplace where you can 
			sell your non-refundable travel online. For us, the concept of SpareFare makes perfect 
			sense: someone with non-refundable airline tickets or hotel reservation will get a partial 
			refund for them. And someone else will buy those unused plane tickets at second-hand 
			prices! This will also reduce the number of empty seats on planes, and obviate the purchase 
			of a yet another seat, so the environment benefits, too!<br><br>
			It is a win-win-win-win situation!<br><br>
			If you think that it makes perfect sense too, why don't you start with our registration 
			page? You can't use the service unless you are registered.<br><br>
			You probably have a ton of questions about how this is going to work - find the answers in 
			the How It Works steps and videos on the home page or visit the <a href="faq.php" style="color: blue;"><b>FAQs</b></a> page.<br><br>
